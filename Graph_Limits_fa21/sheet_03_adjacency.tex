\title{Sheet 3: The Adjacency matrix}
\author{Xianzhi Wang}
\date{fall 2021}
\maketitle

All graphs are finite on this sheet. Let $G$ be a directed graph on the
vertex set $\{1,\ldots,n\}$. Let us define the \emph{adjacency matrix} $A=%
\mathrm{Adj}(G)$ by setting 
\begin{equation*}
A_{i,j}=\text{number of edges from }i\text{ to }j\text{ in }G\text{.}
\end{equation*}
So, we allow multiple edges and even loops in $G$.

\begin{exercise}
Express the following in linear algebra terms, using $A$: \newline
1)\ the degrees of a vertex;\newline
2) the number of edges in $G$; \newline
3) $e(X,Y)$ for $X,Y\subseteq V(G)$.
\end{exercise}

One of the main reasons why we look at the adjacency (or neighboring)
relation as a matrix is the following correspondance between matrix
multiplication and walks in $G$.

\begin{definition}
A \emph{directed walk of length }$n$ in $G$ is a sequence of directed edges $%
e_{1},\ldots,e_{n}$ such that $e_{i}^{+}=e_{i+1}^{-}$ ($1\leq i\leq n-1$).
The walk is a \emph{loop (or returning)}, if $e_{1}^{-}=e_{n}^{+}$.
\end{definition}

Note that we redefine the notion of walk here: it is a sequence of edges
rather than vertices.

\begin{theorem}
For every $k>0$, $(A^{k})_{i,j}$ equals the number of directed walks of
length $k$ from $i$ to $j$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Let's prove by induction.\\
    When $k=1, \ (A)_{ij}$ is indeed the number of
    directed walks of length $1$,
    (which is just directed edge) from $i$ to $j$ by definition.\\
    Assume true for $k-1$.\\
    Denote the $ij$th entry of $A$ by $a_{ij}$ and $ij$th 
    entry of $A^{k-1}$ by $b_{ij}$
    \begin{align}
        (A^k)_{i,j} = (A \cdot A^{k-1})_{i,j} = \sum_{\alpha = 1}^{n} a_{i \alpha} b_{\alpha j}
    \end{align}
    Thus, for fixed $\alpha$, we multiply together $a_{i \alpha} b_{\alpha j}$,
    which means multiply number of directed walks of length $1$
    (which are directed edges) from $i$ to $\alpha$ and the 
    number of directed walks of length $k-1$ from $\alpha$ to $j$.
    After this, we sum over $\alpha$, which run through $1$ to $n$,
    and the result $\sum_{\alpha = 1}^{n} a_{i \alpha} b_{\alpha j}$
    is indeed number of directed walks of length $k$.\\
    Thus, we have proved the theorem using induction.
\end{proof}


\begin{corollary}
For every $k>0$, the trace $\mathrm{tr}(A^{k})$ equals the number of loops
of length $k$ in $G$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
    Since $(A^k)_{ii}$ equals the number of directed walks
    of length $k$ from $i$ to $i$, (i.e., a loop),
    we could sum over the $n$ entries in the diagonal
    to obtain all the loops of length $k$ in $G$.
    This is exactly $tr (A^k)$.
    
\end{proof}


Now assume that $G$ is undirected.

This turns $A$ to be a symmetric real matrix. Using the spectral theorem, it
follows that $A$ admits an orthonormal eigenbasis $b_{0}(G),b_{1}(G),%
\ldots,b_{n-1}(G)$ with real eigenvalues $\lambda_{0}(G)\geq\lambda
_{1}(G)\geq\ldots\geq\lambda_{n-1}(G)$. That is, we have 
\begin{equation*}
Ab_{i}=\lambda_{i}b_{i}\text{ \ }(0\leq i<n). 
\end{equation*}
Note that the $\lambda_{i}$ are well defined, but the $b_{i}$ are not. Also:

\begin{lemma}
The eigenvalues are graph invariants, that is, isomorphic graphs have the
same eigenvalues.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Isomorphic graphs have the same eigenvalues. Since 
    Isomorphic graphs are structurally the same, 
    they have the exact same adjacency matrix, 
    thus the same eigenvalues.
\end{proof}


\begin{exercise}
Compute $\lambda_{i}$ and $b_{i}$ for the triangle.
\end{exercise}

One way to visualize the adjacency matrix as an operator is as follows.
Write real numbers on the vertices of $G$, call this function $f$. Now $A$
acts by taking all neighbors of the vertex $x$, add up the $f$-values there
and write it to the position $x$. This will be the value of $Af$ at $x$: 
\begin{equation*}
(Af)(x)=\dsum \limits_{(x,y)\in E(G)}f(y)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Actually this is how we will \emph{define} the adjacency operator for
infinite graphs. Using this image, one can prove.

\begin{theorem}
Let $G$ be an undirected graph with maximal degree $d$. Then $\left\vert
\lambda_{i}(G)\right\vert \leq d$ ($0\leq i<n$). When $G$ is $d$-regular, we
have $\lambda_{0}(G)=d$.
\end{theorem}

Hint: take an eigenvector. Find a particular vertex for it..

\begin{exercise}
Assume that $G$ is undirected and connected with maximal degree $d$. Then $%
\lambda_{0}(G)=d$ if and only if $G$ is $d$-regular.
\end{exercise}

\begin{lemma}
Let $G$ be a $d$-regular undirected graph. Then the multiplicity of $d$ as
an eigenvalue of $G$ equals the number of connected components of $G$.
\end{lemma}

The eigenvalue $-d$ also comes into the picture naturally.

\begin{lemma}
Let $G$ be a $d$-regular undirected, connected graph. Then $\lambda_{n-1}=-d 
$ if and only if $G$ is bipartite.
\end{lemma}

\begin{exercise}
Let $G$ be a $d$-regular undirected graph. What is the multiplicity of $-d$
as an eigenvalue of $G$?
\end{exercise}

Now we look at some simple examples.

\begin{exercise}
Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the cycle of length $n$.
\end{exercise}

Hint: What are the eigenvalues for the directed cycle of length $n$?

\begin{exercise}
Compute the eigenvalues and an orthonormal eigenbasis for the complete graph
on $d+1$ points.
\end{exercise}

Hint: What happens to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $A$ if you add a
scalar matrix to $A$?
