\begin{homeworkProblem}
    Suppose that a group $G$ has order $312$. 
    Prove that $G$ has a proper normal subgroup.\\
    \solution

    $312 = 2^3 \times 3 \times 13$.\\
    The number of Sylow $p=2$ subgroup, $n$, has several possibilities 
    \begin{align}
        1,3,13,39 &\equiv \mod p=2
    \end{align}
    and they divide $m = 3 \times 13$.\\
    The number of Sylow $p = 3$ subgroup, $n$ has several possibilities.
    \begin{align}
        1,4,13 &\equiv 1 \mod p=3\\
    \end{align}
    and they divide $m = 8 \cdot 13$.\\
    However, the number of Sylow $p=13$ subgroup
    is one, since $1$ is the only number $\equiv 1 \mod p=13$
    and divide $m = 2^3 \cdot 3$ at the same time.\\
    By Sylow's theorem, (and corollary)
    $G$ has a proper normal subgroup of order $13$.\\
    The unique Sylow $13$ subgroup.\\

\begin{homeworkProblem}
    Suppose that a group $G$ has order $1960$. Prove that $G$ has a proper normal subgroup.\\
    \solution

    Suppose a group has order $1960 = 2^3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7^2$, 
    the number of Sylow $p=2$ subgroup has several possibilites 
    \begin{align}
        1,5,7 \equiv 1 \mod p = 2
    \end{align}
    and divide $m = 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 7$.\\
    The number of Sylow $p=5$ subgroup has several possibilities, 
    for example, $1,56, 196 \equiv 1 \mod p = 5$
    and divide $m = 2^3 \cdot 7^2$.\\
    But the number $n$ of Sylow $p = 7$ subgroup has $2$ 
    possibilities 
    \begin{align}
        1,8 &\equiv 1 \mod p = 7\\
    \end{align}
    and divide $m = 2^3 \cdot 5 = 40$.\\
    Suppose $n = 8$. (If $n=1$, then we are done)\\
    Since $G$ acts on $Syl_7 (G)$ by conjugation 
    and the action is transitive, $G$ is 
    essentially permuting the $8 Syl_7 (G)$ subgroups.\\
    Thus, we could define a homomorphism
    \begin{align}
        G \xrightarrow[]{\psi} S_8
    \end{align}
    ($\psi$ is indeed a homomorphism 
    because of the definition of group action)\\
    $ker \psi$ cannot be the whole group $G$, 
    since $G$ acts transitively on the 
    $Syl_7 (G)$ groups, and we are assuming 
    there is $8$ of them, 
    so $\psi$ cannot map everything in $G$ to the identity permutation.\\

\begin{homeworkProblem}
For $A \leq G, \ \lvert G:A \rvert$ finite and $A$ abelian,
let $\tau_{G \mapsto A}$ denote the transfer 
homomorphism from $G$ to $A$. Let $g \in G$
and $b \in N_G(A)$. Show that 
$\tau_{G \mapsto A} (g)$ commutes with $b$.\\
Hint: If $ h_1, \ldots, h_{n} $ is a set of right coset representatives 
of $A$ then show that $ bh_1, \ldots, bh_n $ is also a set of right
coset representatives of $A$.
